# search-images: Find text inside images

![search-images](media/search-for-text.png)

How to solve a (not so theoretical) problem:

> I'm documenting a UI, and a term in the UI has changed.  How do I find all the images that use this term?  I have 100s (or even 1000s) of images, and I don't want to have to open each one!

The **search-images.py** Python script searches for your text inside images. It's set up to search for images in any **media** folder inside [MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs).  It creates a .csv file listing the files that match your search phrase, and a .md file with a preview of each image. 

You can search for multiple terms.  You can also specify whether the search is case sensitive or not (default is case sensitive).

## Prerequisites

* Create a [Computer Vision resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision) in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.

    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. Add your key and endpoint as environment variables as shown below.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

* Create a [GitHub personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).

    * In step 11, select **Public Repositories (read-only)** to search through any public repo, such as azure-docs.  If you want to search a private repo or a fork, specify the access details to that repository in the token.  
    * Make sure to copy the token as soon as it's created.  Once you move away, you'll never see it again.

* Create the following environment variables to be accessed when you run the Python script:
    * `GH_ACCESS_TOKEN` - the token you created from Github
    * `COMPUTER_VISION_ENDPOINT` - the endpoint you created from the OCR Quickstart
    * `COMPUTER_VISION_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` - the key you created from the OCR Quickstart

* Use Codespaces to skip setting up your local computer - the button below creates a codespace with all required libraries installed. Save your variables as [Codespace secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-your-account-specific-secrets-for-github-codespaces), with access to sdgilley/search-images for each environment variable above.

* If you want to run this in VS Code locally, see [Getting Started with Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).  You'll need to install the following packages:

    ```console
    pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
    pip install pillow
    pip install PyGithub  
    ```

> ðŸ“˜ BEFORE YOU START - Clean up your images folder!
> 
> Save yourself time by first deleting images that are no longer in use.  For Microsoft articles, use the [Repo cleanup tool](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/help/contribute/clean-repo-tool?branch=main) to get rid of orphaned images.

## Run the script

1. Edit the file **search-image.py** and fill out the `PUT YOUR DETAILS HERE` section with your values.  This is where you say what to search for, where to search, and where to write results.

1. Run **search-images.py**.
    * Go grab a coffee, go to lunch, or find something else to work on.  
    * For 600 images, the script took approximately 15 minutes to complete. Your milage may vary.

## Results

Results are printed to the screen, so that you can watch the progress.  They are also added to a .csv file and a .md file (the .md file shows a preview of each image).

* If the file contains the search term, it is added to the results with status showing the term found.
* If the file can't be processed, it is added to the results with a status of "unknown".  You'll need to manually inspect these files.
* If the file doesn't contain the search term, you won't see it it in the results.


## Future directions

* You could adapt the script to process local files, following the example from [OCR: Read File using the Read API, extract text - local](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py#L99). Note the sleep time in that loop is 10 times larger than for online files.
